# 🔐 Password Strength Checker with Optimization  
*A rule-based system to evaluate and automatically improve weak passwords with minimal edits.*

---

## 📘 Overview

Weak, predictable passwords are a major cause of security breaches.  
Users often choose passwords that are easy to remember but vulnerable to brute force, dictionary attacks, and pattern-based guessing.

This project provides:

- Accurate password strength evaluation  
- Automatic optimization of weak passwords  
- Minimal and meaningful edits  
- High-entropy, strong suggestions (score ≥ 70)  
- 100% rule-based — no ML required  
- Fast and deterministic output  
- Full frontend + backend implementation  

The method is fully based on the mathematical model and optimization algorithm described in the project document.

# 🧩 Problem Statement

Users commonly create weak passwords due to convenience and memorability.  
Even when strength checks exist, they rarely provide **actionable, minimal-change suggestions**.

The goal is to design a system that:

1. **Accurately evaluates password strength**  
2. **Automatically generates improved versions of weak passwords**  
3. **Makes as few edits as possible (minimal edit distance)**  
4. **Ensures the improved password meets the strength threshold**  
5. **Avoids ML or brute-force search**  

The optimization is defined as:

\[
\text{Minimize } D(s, s') \quad \text{subject to} \quad Str(s') \ge 70
\]

Where **D(s, s′)** is the edit distance.

# 🚀 Approach Used

This project uses a **Greedy Rule-Based Optimization Algorithm**.  
It sequentially applies the most impactful rule to reach the required strength with minimal edits.

## 1️⃣ Strength Evaluation Model

Password strength is calculated as:

\[
Str(s') = w_L\,flen(L) + w_c\,f_{classes}(s') + w_e\,Entropy(s') - w_p\,f_{penalty}(s')
\]

### Components (as per Slides 5–12):

✔ **Length Score (flen)**  
✔ **Character Class Score**  
✔ **Entropy Calculation (Shannon)**  
✔ **Common-Word Penalty**  
✔ **Weighted scoring system**  

A password is considered strong if:

\[
Str(s') \ge 70
\]

## 2️⃣ Greedy Optimization Steps

The optimizer applies the following minimal-edit rules **in priority order**:

### ✔ Step 1 — If already strong, stop  
(Slide 14)

### ✔ Step 2 — Ensure minimum length  
If length < 8 → append safe characters (`Xy9!`).  
(Slide 15)

### ✔ Step 3 — Add missing character classes  
Add exactly one character from each missing class:  
- lowercase → `a`  
- uppercase → `A`  
- digit → `7`  
- special → `!`  
(Slide 15)

### ✔ Step 4 — Remove dictionary/common words  
Transform weak patterns:  
- `password` → `P@ssw0rd`  
- `1234` → `1#3$`  
- `qwerty` → `Qw3rTy`  
(Slide 15)

### ✔ Step 5 — Increase entropy  
Replace repeated characters with random strong characters.  
(Slide 15)

### ✔ Step 6 — Recompute score  
Stop when score ≥ 70.  
(Slide 16)

### ✔ Step 7 — Generate final suggestions  
Produces 2–3 strong optimized variations.  
Example (Slides 16):  
- `P@ssw0rd123!`  
- `Passw0rd#Xy`  
- `P9G5Xy12025`

# Password Strength Optimizer — Run locally

This project contains a small backend API and a frontend SPA. The backend now serves the frontend static files, so you can run everything from one process.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (16+ recommended) and npm installed

Quick start (recommended)
1. From the project root run:

```powershell
npm run install-all
npm start
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The frontend and API are served on the same origin.

Alternative — run backend directly
1. Install dependencies and start backend:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Advanced — run frontend separately (not required)
If you'd rather run the frontend using a static server (for example during development):

```powershell
cd frontend
npx serve .
```

Notes
- The backend start command runs `node server.js` (see `backend/package.json`). The server listens on port 3000 and serves both API endpoints (under `/api`) and the frontend files.
- Frontend fetches the API via a relative path (`/api/checkPassword`) so both running on the same origin works correctly.
